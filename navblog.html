                <h3>Best Countries to visit in SouthEast asia</h3>
                <p>I arrived for the first time in Thailand way back in 2012. I was fresh off the plane, wide-eyed, with no idea what incredible things would await me. My plan was to go backpacking for one month, but I loved it so much that I continued to wander the region for a year. Ever since I’ve been coming back to Southeast Asia for more.</p>

                        <p>Myanmar is definitely one of the least visited countries in Southeast Asia, but maybe that’s what makes it so special and unique. If you wish to get a break from hyper-touristy destinations in Asia like Thailand, you’ll be happy to hear that Myanmar is a relatively unexplored destination. There are no overcrowded beaches here, everything (except hotels) is dirt cheap, and the locals don’t treat you as an ATM.</p>

                        <p>Among the main attractions in Yangon is the Shwedagon Pagoda, a huge gold-roofed Buddhist temple. Sunset is an excellent time to go as the dome will be gleaming beautifully in the orange sun.</p>

                        <p>Chiang Mai has a population of over 1 million (within the greater Chiang Mai area) which makes it the largest city in northern Thailand. Fortunately, it doesn’t feel overwhelming — Chiang Mai is very green, low-rise, and pretty. Its center is bounded by an ancient city wall and moat, creating a very walkable downtown area that invites random exploration. Chiang Mai is both budget-friendly and cosmopolitan, with many hip cafes, an artsy scene, and many international cuisines available.</p>
